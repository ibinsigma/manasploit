# manasploit

# Objective :
To predict the time , location ( latitude and longitude ) of an earthquake using the data about the past earthquakes which have a magnitude above 5.5 
The output will contain the **latitude, longitude and the depth** of the earthquake
- - - -
## Implementation : 
The dataset will be passed through a Neural Network Model .
Further optimization will be done using the Machine Learning algorithms

## Detailed description :

This repository is associated with various machine learning and optimization techniques used for the prediction of earthquakes. 
Various methods are applied taking the raw fields of the original dataset as well as certain useful features extracted from the original dataset as input to the various machine learning models.
Extraction of the features are done to create a feature vector using ML algorithms which is then passed on to the Neural Network and the model gets the dataset as a `<.csv>` file.
The dataset will be further normalized .
Accuracy will be tested on testing data .

## Libraries to be used :

Tensorflow
Pandas
Matplotlib
Numpy

## Language
Python

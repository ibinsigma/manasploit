# Manasploit

# Objective :

To predict the **magnitude** of earthquake at a place by taking the latitude, longitude and depth of a place below the surface.

## Implementation : 

- The dataset will be passed through a Artificial Neural Network.

- Further optimization will be done using the Machine Learning algorithms.

- - - -
## Detailed description :

 - Dataset downloaded from (xyz) was read using Pandas and features were extracted using NumPy.
 - Model is built using Tensorflow library and id trained with the data previously acquired.
 - The model thus built is saved and the input taken from the user is fed into the ANN to predict the magnitude of earthquake which might occur at a given location.
